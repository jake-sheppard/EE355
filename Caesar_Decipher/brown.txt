  -----------------------------------------------


Ingredients

1 loaf day old Italian bread
3 garlic cloves, mashed
9 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil
1/4 teaspoon plus 1 pinch kosher salt
2 eggs
2 heads romaine lettuce, inner leaves only
7 grinds black pepper
1 lemon, juiced
6 drops Worcestershire sauce
1/4 cup grated Parmesan cheese

Directions
Heat oven to 350 degrees.

Cut 1/2 to 3/4-inch croutons from the loaf of bread and place on a baking 
sheet and put into the oven until dry but not browned.

Use a mortar and pestle to mash the garlic with 4 tablespoons of oil and 
1/4 teaspoon kosher salt. Strain the oil into a skillet over medium heat. 
Add the dried croutons and fry, tossing constantly until all of the oil 
is absorbed and the croutons turn gold. Set aside.

Bring 2 cups water to a boil in a small saucepan. Add the eggs and cook 
for 1 minute. Chill in ice water to halt cooking. Set aside.

In a very large bowl, tear lettuce and toss with 3 tablespoons of olive 
oil. Sprinkle with the remaining kosher salt and the black pepper. Add 
the remaining olive oil. Toss well. Add the lemon juice and Worcestershire 
sauce. Break in the eggs. Toss until a creamy dressing forms. Toss in 
Parmesan cheese and serve with croutons.
